Dear Maxime DUVAL and Raphael GINOULHAC,

Thank you for sending your project proposal. Sorry for the late reply,
as your project belongs more to the ‘self proposed’ topics I had to
discuss it with the supervisor.

I am very much interested in combining NAU/NMU and RL. However, your
specification need to be more precise.

The following steps were not clear to me in your proposal:

You are planning to extend [2] with [1] - considering that [2] is
implementation used in [1], it is not clear to me what you are planning
to extend. Can you specify it more?

Please specify what you mean by ‘classical future prediction tasks’.

The step ’integration of the proposed blocks into RL’ is quite a
general specification. What exactly would you like to solve/study? What
quantitative evaluations will you perform?

One of the possible reasons for using NAU/NMU is a generalization. The
policy composed of NAU/NMU units might generalize to the unseen
environments better than NN policy because it will learn actual
equation for control. This approach might provide an alternative
solution to the symbolic regression in RL [3,4].
For example, consider the inverted pendulum with different masses (mass
is part of the state) trained by domain randomization. If we learn the
NN policy for masses below 1 kg, it is unlikely that the policy will
work for larger mass, because it was not part of the training. On the
other side, due to the extrapolation capability of NAU/NMU, the policy
which consists of them might learn the equation and work for larger
mass.

Would you be interested in performing such analysis?

In addition, please propose the division of work and the
software/algorithms you plan to use.

Best regards,
Vladimir Petrik
